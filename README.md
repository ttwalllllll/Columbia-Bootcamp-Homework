## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Per their whitepaper, they are trying to address a few different problems in the music industry:

    1. There is little to no transparency around the origins
        of artist payouts (e.g. number of plays, location,
        original gross payment before fees)
    2. Incomplete rights ownership data often prevents
        content artists from getting paid; instead, earnings
        accumulate in digital service providers (DSPs) and
        rights societies
    3. There are layers of middlemen and significant time
        delay involved in payments to artists
    4. Publishing rights are complicated and opaque, with
        no incentives for the industry to make rights data
        public and accurate
    5. Remixes, covers, and other derivative content are
        largely censored due to rights management issues
    6. Licensing issues prevent DSPs and content from being accessible worldwide

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

The intended customers for the platform is artists and their fans.

The music industry in 2017 generated $47B but only 12% of it was distributed to artists. By comparison, they show how the NFL shares about 47% of revenue and the NBA share about 49% - 51%.

Other websites state about half that revenue in 2020, but that only takes into consideration listening to the music and not other sources like "business-to-business (B2B) revenues (Music Publishing and Licensing) and music ads (AM/FM, YouTube) are flattish, consumer outlays (Concerts, Subscriptions) are at all-time highs."

Audius aims to eliminate the middleman/middlewoman by giving complete control to the artists and fans. This will close the revenue sharing gap significantly.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Audius is currently using the ethereum blockchain to solve the music industry's problems. The token $AUDIO is the basis of their platform but they also plan to incorporate stablecoins and potentially artist driven tokens to allow for more flexibility.

$AUDIO will be used as the governance token and new proposals will be community driven. You can see here: https://dashboard.audius.org/#/


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Music industry.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

Over the last decade you have seen the evolution of the music industry from primarily physical products to an industry that now lives on the web. Traditional products like concerts, merchandize, etc. have not disappeared and will most likely see an increase in revenue as lockdowns subside. 

We have seen the proliferation of music and have seen its accessibility increase with digitization and streaming services, but like the music labels of old, the streaming services control the revenue for artists.

The advent of blockchain is poised to potentially change that.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

The closest competitor would probably be Soundcloud as they cater to upcoming artists more and the majority of artists on Audius are newer artists.

Right now there aren't any real competitors using blockchain to disrupt the music industry. If they wanted, Apple and Spotify could come in and do something similar for artists/fans but the economics of it don't justify Apple or Spotify getting into the business.


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

The business impact has been minimal but the idea is out there. When they first started circa 2018, they had DAU of 200k. They are at 2million now with 50k artists. With a continued understanding of blockchain and the economics of it, the company should be able to have a better impact.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Using Spotify and Apple Music as examples. 

Per Spotify's investor relations webpage, here are some of the metrics that they tracks:

    Monthly active users: 345m
    Number of Subscribers: 155m
    Number of tracks: 70m
    Number of markets: 178
    
Apple groups their music revenue into "digital content", but does not breakout their metrics.

Audius metrics:

    Active $AUDIO staked: 198m
    API Calls this month: 49m
    Unique users this month: 4m
    Estimated weekly reward: 0.67%
    Estimated annual reward rate: 35%
    Number of tracks (per Rollingstone): 250k
    Number of artists: 50k
    

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

It is a start. 1% of MAU of Spotify. If they can attract more notable artists, they can capture a larger audience. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

I like the idea of providing artists the opportunity to create their own tokens to appeal to dedicated fans. The service is free right now, but at some point they will bring ads in and that will lead to a premium service just like Spotify and Apple Music.

They will be able to sell NFTs of digital art or unique works by the artists. They can become ticket brokers and eliminate that industry (ensure the secure transfer of tickers and eliminate fraud).

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

For specifically this service, the more the company focuses on the artist, the better off they are. The better off the artist is, fans will then benefit. 

A platform that pays them 90% of revenue (estimate) means they will be able to retain any artist for the foreseeable future. The platform will allow them to become their own digital label and control every aspect of their business.
